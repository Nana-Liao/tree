Drawing inspiration from the philosophical concept of the Eternal Return and the Buddhist concept of Samsara, and explores themes such as the finite and the infinite, the transient and the eternal, and the interconnectedness of individuals within the greater whole.



By incorporating various artistic elements, <Tree> offers an immersive and captivating experience for its audience. The installation ingeniously combines textile fabrics and projections to create a captivating representation of a tree. Each frame captures a comprehensive panoramic view of the tree at a specific moment and is projected onto layered textile fabric composed of special materials, forming the central element of the installation. This meticulous composition enables viewers to witness the profound transformation of the tree across the four seasons, starting from barren branches, transitioning to vibrant greenery and blossoms, and ultimately returning to barrenness.



The installation prompts contemplation on the cyclic nature of existence, encouraging introspection about free will, personal choices, and the profound meaning of our existence. It urges viewers to reflect on the intricate interplay between individual lives and the broader interconnected whole, emphasizing that even when surface appearances remain the same, each iteration shares similarities yet possesses unique qualities. Even in the face of nihilism and the perpetual oscillation of life's cycles, <Tree> encourages a celebration and love for life.
